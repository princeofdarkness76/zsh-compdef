Various ZSH completion scripts. These require http://www.zsh.org/ and
must be located in a $fpath directory, for example in ~/.zshrc to add a
custom directory to place these files and then to turn on completion:

  fpath=(~/.zsh/functions $fpath)
  autoload -U compinit && compinit

* For more info on ZSH completion, consult:

  http://zshwiki.org/home/examples/compquickstart
  http://bewatermyfriend.org/p/2012/003/

  or try #zsh on the Freenode IRC network. (Do *not* use OMZ. It is
  buggy baggage. (Or any other shell "framework" that you do not
  understand.))

* Even more completion scripts can be found under:

  http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Arc/git.html
  https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/

* Many of the completions here are for utilities under:

  or one or the other of my Perl modules (see github, CPAN).
